# auto-handbrake
 A tool for automatically scanning directories and compressing videos on schedule.

 ## Why?

 I needed a solution for automatically compressing videos that were sent to our household NAS. I wanted some degree of automation, so I wrote this to run on my media server.


 ## How to run

 In order to get this to work, you will need to get a copy of [handbrake-cli](https://handbrake.fr/downloads2.php), and configure a configuration profile. I'll detail this a bit more if this project gets any interest.
